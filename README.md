# leaflet-challenge
For this challenge, I relied heavily on past lectures and assignments. Doing this at the same time as Project 3 where we were creating somewhat similar visuals helped me get down the basic concepts of how to format
the different features on the map. I had some trouble getting my index to format in a way where it would show the same colors as the markers so I looked at previous questions and posts on W3 Schools website. For any error messages I did not understand, I plugged them into ChatGBT.
